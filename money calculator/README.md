# money-calc

This is a basic money tipping calculator. I used Materilize css framework, jQuery, and Javascript. 

The user can calculate a tip for themselves or split it between multiple people. 

Have a look at the <a href="http://codepen.io/palmtreetheory/pen/zoRMLg">Demo</a>. More Still to come. 

Thanks!
